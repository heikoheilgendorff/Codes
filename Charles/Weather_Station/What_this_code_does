First it reads in the input file from the weatherstation.

Then it goes through this file, line by line and pulls out the relevant information
and appending that info into a variable called weatherData.

Then it goes through weatherData and pulls out the actual values and puts them in variable x.
For example: weatherData has 'outsideTemp=24.2<br>', x has '24.2'

It then gets the date and time of the measurements from x.

Finally, it outputs all the information from x into the format required for the next part of the chain and saves it in a file called weatherDataKlerefontein.txt

All that is required for this to work on Guppy is to copy it to the approriate file and 
change the paths.
