Hi Heiko/Nkululeko

Here are two images taken the other night with the optical camera- not sure if I sent you the link.

What we would need as a first step is just a routine that calculates the pixel offset from the centre of the image.

After that we can calculate the pixel/angle ratio, and infer the pointing error that remains after applying the pointing model and gross az/el offsets.

Then we simply transform the antenna az/el coordinates, to the apparent az/el coordinates (i.e. remove the pointing model from the antenna positions), and recalculate the pointing model using the new data.

The goal would be a to actually (in real time) apply the observed angle correction so as to keep the star in the centre of the frame.
